# ZORD
A small text-based RPG I've been writing.

This has only been tested on Linux(Ubuntu 16.04.2), with xterm, Terminator and gnome-terminal, and Windows 7/10. 256 color mode needed & Linux for terminal coloration.

    TODO: · means not done, - means partially implemented, X means complete.

        NEW FEATURES:

            [·] Most/All items can be enchanted/cursed.

            [·] ARMOR is now introduced into the game.

        IMPROVEMENTS:

            [X] Player classes now give you different starting stats, 
                (e.g. warrior +5 stamina, or mage +5 special points)

            [-] WEAPON Items can now be equipped, have their own stats,
                go blunt(and can break), and can be thrown/dropped.

            [·] FOOD Items now age, meaning they eventually go bad,
                in some cases making them completely inedible/poisonous.


        LONG-TERM GOALS:

            [X] Re-write entire game in Python, or something similar.
